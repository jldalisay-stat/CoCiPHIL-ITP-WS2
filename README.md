# R Shiny Application: Simple Linear Regression Analysis and Power Analysis
## Description
This R Shiny application performs simple linear regression analysis and power analysis for minimum sample size and minimum detectable effect. It allows users to upload a CSV file, select variables for analysis, and choose between different analysis types.

## Installation
Before running the application, ensure you have installed the necessary packages by executing the following code in your R environment:

```{r}
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("plotly")
install.packages("DT")
```
## Running the Application
To run the R Shiny application:
1. Open your preferred R environment.
2. Set the working directory to the location of the downloaded repository using setwd() command.
3. Open the App.R script in your R environment.
4. Run the script (App.R) by either:
   * Highlighting the code and using the ' Run ' command in your R environment.
   * Typing source("App.R") in the R console.
5. The application should launch in your default web browser.
   
## Usage
1. Open your preferred R environment.
2. Set the working directory to the location of the downloaded repository using setwd() command.
3. Open the App.R script in your R environment.
4. Run the script (App.R) by either:
   * Highlighting the code and using the ' Run ' command in your R environment.
   * Typing source("App.R") in the R console.
5. Run the application by executing the provided R script in your R environment.
6.  Access the application in your web browser.
7.   pload a CSV file containing the data for analysis.
8.   Choose the analysis type:
   * Simple Linear Regression: Analyze relationships between variables, view regression plots, and diagnostics.
   * Power Analysis for Minimum Sample Size: Estimate power for different sample sizes.
   * Power Analysis for Minimum Detectable Effect: Estimate power for different effect sizes.
9. Depending on the selected analysis type, input relevant parameters, and click the "Run Analysis" button.
