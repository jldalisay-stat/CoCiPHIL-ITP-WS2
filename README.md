# R Shiny Application: Simple Linear Regression Analysis and Power Analysis
## Description
This R Shiny application performs simple linear regression analysis and power analysis for minimum sample size and minimum detectable effect. It allows users to upload a CSV file, select variables for analysis, and choose between different analysis types.

## Installation
Before running the application, ensure you have installed the necessary packages by executing the following code in your R environment:

```{r}
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("plotly")
install.packages("DT")
```
## Usage
1. Run the application by executing the provided R script in your R environment.
2. Access the application in your web browser.
3. Upload a CSV file containing the data for analysis.
4. Choose the analysis type:
   * Simple Linear Regression: Analyze relationships between variables, view regression plots, and diagnostics.
   * Power Analysis for Minimum Sample Size: Estimate power for different sample sizes.
   * Power Analysis for Minimum Detectable Effect: Estimate power for different effect sizes.
5. Depending on the selected analysis type, input relevant parameters, and click the "Run Analysis" button.
